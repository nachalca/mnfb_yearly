The only requirement is that the shrinkage prior density function can be evaluated up to a normalizing con-stant. The new sampler draws all coefficients simultaneously and simulation studies show that it is markedly more efficient than the Gibbs samplers that are typically used for such models.

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {SUMMARY It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {Hybrids such as maize (Zea mays) or domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) grow bigger and stronger than their parents. This is also true for allopolyploids such as wheat (Triticum spp.) or frog (i.e. Xenopus and Silurana) that contain two or more sets of chromosomes from different species. The phenomenon, known as hybrid vigor or heterosis, was systematically characterized by Charles Darwin (1876). The rediscovery of heterosis in maize a century ago has revolutionized plant and animal breeding and production. Although genetic models for heterosis have been rigorously tested, the molecular bases remain elusive. Recent studies have determined the roles of nonadditive gene expression, small RNAs, and epigenetic regulation, including circadian-mediated metabolic pathways, in hybrid vigor, which could lead to better use and exploitation of the increased biomass and yield in hybrids and allopolyploids for food, feed, and biofuels.},

abstract = {Deep sequencing of RNAs (RNA-seq) has been a useful tool to characterize and quantify transcriptomes. However, there are significant challenges in the analysis of RNA-seq data, such as how to separate signals from sequencing bias and how to perform reasonable normalization. Here, we focus on a fundamental question in RNA-seq analysis: the distribution of the position-level read counts. Specifically, we propose a two-parameter generalized Poisson (GP) model to the position-level read counts. We show that the GP model fits the data much better than the traditional Poisson model. Based on the GP model, we can better estimate gene or exon expression, perform a more reasonable normalization across different samples, and improve the identification of differentially expressed genes and the identification of differentially spliced exons. The usefulness of the GP model is demonstrated by applications to multiple RNA-seq data sets.},

@article{Waters2013,
abstract = {In plants, a subset of genes exhibit imprinting in endosperm tissue such that expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. Imprinting may arise as a consequence of mechanisms for silencing of transposons during reproduction, and in some cases imprinted expression of particular genes may provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species. Separate mechanisms for the origin of imprinted expression patterns and maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the targets of imprinting in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes, providing a comprehensive analysis that allows evaluation of imprinting at more than 95{\%} of endosperm-expressed genes. We find that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on a subset of these genes that had {\textgreater}90{\%} expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10{\%} of imprinted genes show evidence of allelic variation for imprinting. A comparison of imprinting in maize and rice reveals that 13{\%} of genes with syntenic orthologs in both species exhibit conserved imprinting. Genes that exhibit conserved imprinting between maize and rice have elevated nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios compared with other imprinted genes, suggesting a history of more rapid evolution. Together, these data suggest that imprinting only has functional relevance at a subset of loci that currently exhibit imprinting in maize.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of expression levels from RNA-Seq data entails precise mapping of the sequence reads to a reference genome. Because the standard reference genome contains only one allele at any given locus, reads overlapping polymorphic loci that carry a non-reference allele are at least one mismatch away from the reference and, hence, are less likely to be mapped. This bias in read mapping leads to inaccurate estimates of allele-specific expression (ASE). To address this read-mapping bias, we propose the construction of an enhanced reference genome that includes the alternative alleles at known polymorphic loci. We show that mapping to this enhanced reference reduced the read-mapping biases, leading to more reliable estimates of ASE. Experiments on simulated data show that the proposed strategy reduced the number of loci with mapping bias by ≥ 63{\%} when compared with a previous approach that relies on masking the polymorphic loci and by ≥ 18{\%} when compared with the standard approach that uses an unaltered reference. When we applied our strategy to actual RNA-Seq data, we found that it mapped up to 15{\%} more reads than the previous approaches and identified many seemingly incorrect inferences made by them.},

abstract = {Microarray analysis of gene expression patterns in immature ear, seedling, and embryo tissues from the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 identified numerous genes with variable expression. Some genes had detectable expression in only one of the two inbreds; most of these genes were detected in the genomic DNA of both inbreds, indicating that the expression differences are likely caused by differential regulation rather than by differences in gene content. Gene expression was also monitored in the reciprocal F1 hybrids B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73. The reciprocal F1 hybrid lines did not display parental effects on gene expression levels. Approximately 80{\%} of the differentially expressed genes displayed additive expression patterns in the hybrids relative to the inbred parents. The approximately 20{\%} of genes that display nonadditive expression patterns tend to be expressed at levels within the parental range, with minimal evidence for novel expression levels greater than the high parent or less than the low parent. Analysis of allele-specific expression patterns in the hybrid suggested that intraspecific variation in gene expression levels is largely attributable to cis-regulatory variation in maize. Collectively, our data suggest that allelic cis-regulatory variation between B73 and Mo17 dictates maintenance of inbred allelic expression levels in the F1 hybrid, resulting in additive expression patterns.},

Although the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs have been extensively studied, their expression diversity and evolution in closely related species and interspecific hybrids are poorly understood. Here, we show comprehensive analyses of miRNA expression and siRNA distributions in two closely related species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, a natural allotetraploid Arabidopsis suecica, and two resynthesized allotet-raploid lines (F 1 and F7) derived from A. thaliana and A. arenosa. We found that repeat-and transposon-associated siRNAs were highly divergent between A. thaliana and A. arenosa. A. thaliana siRNA populations underwent rapid changes in F 1 but were stably main-tained in F7 and A. suecica. The correlation between siRNAs and nonadditive gene expression in allopolyploids is insignificant. In contrast, miRNA and tasiRNA sequences were conserved between species, but their expression patterns were highly variable be-tween the allotetraploids and their progenitors. Many miRNAs tested were nonadditively expressed (deviating from the mid-parent value, MPV) in the allotetraploids and triggered unequal degradation of A. thaliana or A. arenosa targets. The data suggest that small RNAs produced during interspecific hybridization or polyploidization serve as a buffer against the genomic shock in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids: Stable inheritance of re-peat-associated siRNAs maintains chromatin and genome stability, whereas expression variation of miRNAs leads to changes in gene expression, growth vigor, and adaptation.},

abstract = {When analyzing data sampled with unequal inclusion probabilities, correlations between the probability of selection and the sampled data can induce bias if the inclusion probabilities are ignored in the analysis. Weights equal to the inverse of the probability of inclusion are commonly used to correct possible bias. When weights are uncorrelated with the descriptive or model estimators of interest, highly disproportional sample designs resulting in large weights can introduce unnecessary variability, leading to an overall larger mean square error compared to unweighted methods. We describe an approach we term 'weight smoothing' that models the interactions between the weights and the estimators as random effects, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by shrinking interactions toward zero when such shrinkage is allowed by the data. This article adapts a flexible Laplace prior distribution for the hierarchical Bayesian model to gain a more robust bias-variance tradeoff than previous approaches using normal priors. Simulation and application suggest that under a linear model setting, weight-smoothing models with Laplace priors yield robust results when weighting is necessary, and provide considerable reduction in RMSE otherwise. In logistic regression models, estimates using weight-smoothing models with Laplace priors are robust, but with less gain in efficiency than in linear regression settings.},

@article{Panousis2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is the current gold-standard method to quantify gene expression for expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies. However, a potential caveat in these studies is that RNA-seq reads carrying the non-reference allele of variant loci can have lower probability to map correctly to the reference genome, which could bias gene quantifications and cause false positive eQTL associations. In this study, we analyze the effect of this allelic mapping bias in eQTL discovery. RESULTS: We simulate RNA-seq read mapping over 9.5 M common SNPs and indels, with 15.6{\%} of variants showing biased mapping rate for reference versus non-reference reads. However, removing potentially biased RNA-seq reads from an eQTL dataset of 185 individuals has a very small effect on gene and exon quantifications and eQTL discovery. We detect only a handful of likely false positive eQTLs, and overall eQTL SNPs show no significant enrichment for high mapping bias. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RNA-seq quantifications are generally robust against allelic mapping bias, and that this does not have a severe effect on eQTL discovery. Nevertheless, we provide our catalog of putatively biased loci to allow better controlling for mapping bias to obtain more accurate results in future RNA-seq studies.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a popular tool for transcriptome profiling in mammals. However, accurate estimation of allele-specific expression (ASE) based on alignments of reads to the reference genome is challenging, because it contains only one allele on a mosaic haploid genome. Even with the information of diploid genome sequences, precise alignment of reads to the correct allele is difficult because of the high-similarity between the corresponding allele sequences. We propose a Bayesian approach to estimate ASE from RNA-Seq data with diploid genome sequences. In the statistical framework, the haploid choice is modeled as a hidden variable and estimated simultaneously with isoform expression levels by variational Bayesian inference. Through the simulation data analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of identifying ASE compared to the existing approach. We also show that our approach enables better quantification of isoform expression levels compared to the existing methods, TIGAR2, RSEM and Cufflinks. In the real data analysis of the human reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878, some autosomal genes were identified as ASE genes, and skewed paternal X-chromosome inactivation in GM12878 was identified. The proposed method, called ASE-TIGAR, enables accurate estimation of gene expression from RNA-Seq data in an allele-specific manner. Our results show the effectiveness of utilizing personal genomic information for accurate estimation of ASE. An implementation of our method is available at

abstract = {In hierarchical Bayesian modeling of normal means, it is common to complete the prior specification by choosing a constant prior density for unmodeled hyperparameters (e.g., variances and highest-level means). This common practice often results in an inadequate overall prior, inadequate in the sense that estimators resulting from its use can be inadmissible under quadratic loss. In this paper, hierarchical priors for normal means are categorized in terms of admissibility and inadmissibility of resulting estimators for a quite general scenario. The Jeffreys prior for the hyper-variance and a shrinkage prior for the hypermeans are recommended as admissible alternatives. Incidental to this analysis is presentation of the conditions under which the (generally improper) priors result in proper posteriors.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. We consider the choice of an optimal sample size for multiple-comparison problems. The motivating application is the choice of the number of microarray experiments to be carried out when learning about differential gene expression. However, the approach is valid in any application that involves multiple comparisons in a large number of hypothesis tests. We discuss two decision problems in the context of this setup: the sample size selection and the decision about the multiple comparisons. We adopt a decision-theoretic approach, using loss functions that combine the competing goals of discovering as many differentially expressed genes as possible, while keeping the number of false discoveries manageable. For consistency, we use the same loss function for both decisions. The decision rule that emerges for the multiple-comparison problem takes the exact form of the rules proposed in the recent literature to control the posterior expected false discovery rate. For the sample size selection, we combine the expected utility argument with an additional sensitivity analysis, reporting the conditional expected utilities and conditioning on assumed levels of the true differential expression. We recognize the resulting diagnostic as a form of statistical power facilitating interpretation and communication. As a sampling model for observed gene expression densities across genes and arrays, we use a variation of a hierarchical gamma/gamma model. But the discussion of the decision problem is independent of the chosen probability model. The approach is valid for any model that includes positive prior probabilities for the null hypotheses in the multiple comparisons and that allows for efficient marginal and posterior simulation, possibly by dependent Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.},

abstract = {Undirected graphical models are widely used in statistics, physics, and machine vision. However, Bayesian parameter estimation for undirected models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior typically involves the calculation of an intractable normalizing constant. This problem has received much attention, but very little of this has focused on the important practical case where the data consist of noisy or incomplete observations of the underlying hidden structure. This article specifically addresses this problem, comparing two alternate methodologies. In the first of these approaches, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein) is used to efficiently explore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray, Ghahramani, and MacKay) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable nor-malizing constant (a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution is given in Appendix A available in the online supplementary materials). This approach is compared with approximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al.). Applications to estimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from noisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the article targets an approximation to the true posterior due to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) to simulate from the latent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly, in general. Appendix B (online supplementary materials) also describes the nature of the resulting approximation. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

abstract = {Background: Allele specific expression (ASE) has become an important phenotype, being utilized for the detection of cis-regulatory variation, nonsense mediated decay and imprinting in the personal genome, and has been used to both identify disease loci and consider the penetrance of damaging alleles. The detection of ASE using high throughput technologies relies on aligning short-read sequencing data, a process that has inherent biases, and there is still a need to develop fast and accurate methods to detect ASE given the unprecedented growth of sequencing information in big data projects. Results: Here, we present a new approach to normalize RNA sequencing data in order to call ASE events with high precision in a short time-frame. Using simulated datasets we find that our approach dramatically improves reference allele quantification at heterozygous sites versus default mapping methods and also performs well compared to existing techniques for ASE detection, such as filtering methods and mapping to parental genomes, without the need for complex and time consuming manipulation. Finally, by sequencing the exomes and transcriptomes of 96 well-phenotyped individuals of the CARTaGENE cohort, we characterise the levels of ASE across individuals and find a significant association between the proportion of sites undergoing ASE within the genome and smoking. Conclusions: The correct treatment and analysis of RNA sequencing data is vital to control for mapping biases and detect genuine ASE signals. By normalising RNA sequencing information after mapping, we show that this approach can be used to identify biologically relevant signals in personal genomes.},

abstract = { Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful; that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being elicited. It is not necessarily ``true'' in some objectivistic sense, and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions. The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently, one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods. The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families, at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result, now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi, encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable. Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means, because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant. },

We set up decision problems that lead to the use of FDR-based rules and generalizations. Alternative definitions of the probability model and the utility function lead to different rules and problem-specific adjustments. Using a loss function that controls realized FDR we derive an optimal Bayes rule that is a variation of the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) procedure. The cutoff is based on increments in ordered posterior probabilities instead of ordered p- values. Throughout the discussion we take a Bayesian perspective. In particular, we focus on conditional expected FDR, conditional on the data. Variations of the probability model include explicit modeling for dependence. Variations of the utility function include weighting by the extent of a true negative and accounting for the impact in the final decision},

Starting from basic statistics, undergraduate calculus and linear algebra, ideas of both subjective and objective Bayesian analysis are developed to a level where real-life data can be analyzed using the current techniques of statistical computing. Advances in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional problems are covered, as well as important topics such as empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Many topics are at the cutting edge of statistical research. Solutions to common inference problems appear throughout the text along with discussion of what prior to choose. There is a discussion of elicitation of a subjective prior as well as the motivation, applicability, and limitations of objective priors. By way of important applications the book presents microarrays, nonparametric regression via wavelets as well as DMA mixtures of normals, and spatial analysis with illustrations using simulated and real data. Theoretical topics at the cutting edge include high-dimensional model selection and Intrinsic Bayes Factors, which the authors have successfully applied to geological mapping. The style is informal but clear. Asymptotics is used to supplement simulation or understand some aspects of the posterior.},

@article{Peng2010,
abstract = {As a consequence of the " large p small n " characteristic for microarray data, hypothesis tests based on individual genes often result in low average power. There are several proposed tests that attempt to improve power. Among these, the F S test that was developed using the concept of James-Stein shrinkage to estimate the variances showed a striking average power improvement. In this paper, we establish a framework in which we model the key parameters with a distribution to find an optimal Bayes test which we call the MAP test (where MAP stands for Maximum Average Power). Under this framework, the F S test can be derived as an empirical Bayes test approximating the MAP test corresponding to modeling the variances. By modeling both the means and the variances with a distribution, a MAP statistic is derived which is optimal in terms of average power but is computationally intensive. An empirical Bayes test called the F SS test is derived as an approximation to the MAP tests and can be computed instantaneously. The F SS statistic shrinks both the means and the variances and has numerically identical average power to the MAP tests. Much numerical evidence is presented in this paper that shows that the proposed test performs uniformly better in average power than the other tests in the literature, including the classical F test, the F S test, the test of Wright and Simon, the moderated t-test, SAM, Efron's t test, the B-statistic and Storey's optimal discovery procedure. A theory is established which indicates that the proposed test is optimal in power when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR).},

The heterosis phenomenon is extensively utilized in agriculture though the molecular basis is still unknown. In an effort to understand phenotypic heterosis at the molecular level, researchers have begun to compare expression levels of thousands of genes between parental inbred lines and their hybrid offspring to search for evidence of gene expression heterosis. Standard statistical approaches for separately analyzing expression data for each gene can produce biased and highly variable estimates and unreliable tests of heterosis. To address these shortcomings, we develop a hierarchical model to borrow information across genes. Using our modeling framework, we derive empirical Bayes estimators and an inference strategy to identify gene expression heterosis. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the more traditional strategy used to detect gene expression heterosis. This article has supplementary material online.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. RESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data. CONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.},

@inproceedings{James,
abstract = {1. Introduction It has long been customary to measure the adequacy of an estimator by the smallness of its mean squared error. The least squares estimators were studied by Gauss and by other authors later in the nineteenth century. A proof that the best unbiased estimator of a linear function of the means of a set of observed random variables is the least squares estimator was given by Markov [12], a modified version of whose proof is given by David and Neyman [4]. A slightly more general theorem is given by Aitken [1]. Fisher [5] indicated that for large samples the maximum likelihood estimator approximately minimizes the mean squared error when compared with other reasonable estimators. This paper will be concerned with optimum properties or failure of optimum properties of the natural estimator in certain special problems with the risk usually measured by the mean squared error or, in the case of several parameters, by a quadratic function of the estimators. We shall first mention some recent papers on this subject and then give some results, mostly unpublished, in greater detail. Pitman [13] in 1939 discussed the estimation of location and scale parameters and obtained the best estimator among those invariant under the affine trans-formations leaving the problem invariant. He considered various loss functions, in particular, mean squared error. Wald [18], also in 1939, in what may be considered the first paper on statistical decision theory, did the same for loca-tion parameters alone, and tried to show in his theorem 5 that the estimator obtained in this way is admissible, that is, that there is no estimator whose risk is no greater at any parameter point, and smaller at some point. However, his proof of theorem 5 is not convincing since he interchanges the order of integra-tion in (30) without comment, and it is not clear that this integral is absolutely convergent. To our knowledge, no counterexample to this theorem is known, but in higher-dimensional cases, where the analogous argument seems at first glance only slightly less plausible, counterexamples are given in Blackwell [2] (which is discussed briefly at the end of section 3 of this paper) and in [14], This work was supported in part by an ONR contract at Stanford University. 361 362 FOURTH BERKELEY SYMPOSIUM: JAMES AND STEIN which is repeated in section 2 of this paper. In the paper of Blackwell an analogue of Wald's theorem 5 is proved for the special case of a distribution concentrated on a finite arithmetic progression. Hodges and Lehmann [7] proved some results concerning special exponential families, including Wald's theorem 5 for the special problem of estimating the mean of a normal distribution. Some more general results for the estimation of the mean of a normal distribution including sequential estimation with somewhat arbitrary loss function were obtained by Blyth [3] whose method is a principal tool of this paper. Girshick and Savage [6] proved the minimax property (which is weaker than admissibility here) of the natural estimator in Wald's problem and also generalized the results of Hodges and Lehmann to an arbitrary exponential family. Karlin [8] proved Wald's theorem 5 for mean squared error and for certain other loss functions under},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Temperature plays a key role in driving the electricity demand. We adopt the ''recency effect'', a term drawn from psychology, to represent the fact that the electricity demand is affected by the temperatures of the preceding hours. In the load forecasting literature, the temperature variables are often constructed in the form of lagged hourly temperatures and moving average temperatures. In the past, computing power has limited the amount of temperature variables that can be used in a load forecasting model. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study to model the recency effect using a big data approach. We take advantage of modern computing power to answer a fundamental question: how many lagged hourly temperatures and/or moving average temperatures are needed in a regression model in order to capture the recency effect fully without compromising the forecasting accuracy? Using a case study based on data from the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012, we first demonstrate that a model with the recency effect outperforms its counterpart (a.k.a. Tao's Vanilla Benchmark Model) by 18{\%} to 21{\%} for forecasting the load series at the top (aggregated) level. We then model the recency effect in order to customize load forecasting models at the bottom level of a geographic hierarchy, again showing a superiority over the benchmark model of 12{\%} to 15{\%} on average. Finally, we discuss four different implementations of the recency effect modeling by hour of a day. In addition, this paper also presents two interesting findings: 1) the naive models are not useful for benchmark purposes in load forecasting at aggregated level due to their lack of accuracy; and 2) slicing the data into 24 pieces to develop one model for each hour is not necessarily better than building one interaction regression model using all 24 hours together.},

abstract = {Imprinting describes the differential expression of alleles based on their parent of origin. Deep sequencing of RNAs from maize (Zea mays) endosperm and embryo tissue 14 d after pollination was used to identify imprinted genes among a set of {\~{}}12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms between the B73 and Mo17 genotypes. The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm, including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted, while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes. A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes. The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested. Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns. The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.},

abstract = {Hierarchical models are extensively studied and widely used in statistics and many other scientific areas. They provide an effective tool for combining information from similar resources and achieving partial pooling of inference. Since the seminal work by James and Stein (1961) and Stein (1962), shrinkage estimation has become one major focus for hierarchical models. For the homoscedastic normal model, it is well known that shrinkage estimators, especially the James-Stein estimator, have good risk properties. The heteroscedastic model, though more appropriate for practical applications, is less well studied, and it is unclear what types of shrinkage estimators are superior in terms of the risk. We propose in this paper a class of shrinkage estimators based on Stein's unbiased estimate of risk (SURE). We study asymptotic properties of various common estimators as the number of means to be estimated grows (p → ∞). We establish the asymptotic optimality property for the SURE estimators. We then extend our construction to create a class of semi-parametric shrinkage estimators and establish corresponding asymptotic optimality results. We emphasize that though the form of our SURE estimators is partially obtained through a normal model at the sampling level, their optimality properties do not heavily depend on such distributional assumptions. We apply the methods to two real data sets and obtain encouraging results.},

abstract = {Motivation: Detection of allelic imbalances in ChIP-Seq reads is a powerful approach to identify functional non-coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs), either polymorphisms or mutations, which modulate the affinity of transcription factors for chromatin. We present ABC, a computational tool that identifies allele specific binding of transcription factors from aligned ChIP-Seq reads at heterozygous SNVs. ABC controls for potential false positives resulting from biases introduced by the use of short sequencing reads in ChIP-Seq and can efficiently process a large number of heterozygous SNVs. Results: ABC successfully identifies previously characterized functional SNVs, such as the rs4784227 breast cancer risk associated SNP that modulates the affinity of FOXA1 for the chromatin. Implementation: ABC is written in PERL and can be run on any platform with both PERL (≥5.18.1) and R (≥3.1.1) installed. The script requires the PERL Statistics::R module.

Although high-throughput cDNA sequencing offers a unique opportunity to delineate the genome-wide architecture of regulatory variation, new statistical methods need to be developed to capitalize on the wealth of information contained in RNA-seq data sets. To this end, we developed a powerful and flexible hierarchical Bayesian model that combines information across loci to allow both global and locus-specific inferences about allele-specific expression (ASE). We applied our methodology to a large RNA-seq data set obtained in a diploid hybrid of two diverse Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, as well as to RNA-seq data from an individual human genome. Our statistical framework accurately quantifies levels of ASE with specified false-discovery rates, achieving high reproducibility between independent sequencing platforms. We pinpoint loci that show unusual and biologically interesting patterns of ASE, including allele-specific alternative splicing and transcription termination sites. Our methodology provides a rigorous, quantitative, and high-resolution tool for profiling ASE across whole genomes.},

abstract = {Non-Gaussian outcomes are often modeled using members of the so-called exponential family. Notorious members are the Bernoulli model for binary data, leading to logistic regression, and the Poisson model for count data, leading to Poisson regression. Two of the main reasons for extending this family are (1) the occurrence of overdispersion, meaning that the vari-ability in the data is not adequately described by the models, which often exhibit a prescribed mean–variance link, and (2) the accommodation of hier-archical structure in the data, stemming from clustering in the data which, in turn, may result from repeatedly measuring the outcome, for various mem-bers of the same family, etc. The first issue is dealt with through a variety of overdispersion models, such as, for example, the beta-binomial model for grouped binary data and the negative-binomial model for counts. Clustering is often accommodated through the inclusion of random subject-specific ef-fects. Though not always, one conventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. While both of these phenomena may occur simul-taneously, models combining them are uncommon. This paper proposes a broad class of generalized linear models accommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate sets of random effects. We place particular emphasis on so-called conjugate random effects at the level of the mean for the first aspect and normal random effects embedded within the linear pre-dictor for the second aspect, even though our family is more general. The binary, count and time-to-event cases are given particular emphasis. Apart from model formulation, we present an overview of estimation methods, and then settle for maximum likelihood estimation with analytic–numerical in-tegration. Implications for the derivation of marginal correlations functions are discussed. The methodology is applied to data from a study in epileptic seizures, a clinical trial in toenail infection named onychomycosis and sur-vival data in children with asthma.},

However, in our empirical work we study the relative merits of all three paradigms to determine how best to combine them. The paper concludes with two case studies. One is a real data fluid-dynamics computer experiment which benefits from the local nature of our approximation; the second is a synthetic example designed to find the largest data set for which (accurate) GP emulation can be performed on a commensurate predictive set in under an hour.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the predominant tool used in Bayesian parameter estimation for hierarchical models. When the model expands due to an increasing number of hierarchical levels, number of groups at a particular level, or number of observations in each group, a fully Bayesian analysis via MCMC can easily become computationally demanding, even intractable. We illustrate how the steps in an MCMC for hierarchical models are predominantly one of two types: conditionally independent draws or low-dimensional draws based on summary statistics of parameters at higher levels of the hierarchy. Parallel computing can increase efficiency by performing embarrassingly parallel computations for conditionally independent draws and calculating the summary statistics using parallel reductions. During the MCMC algorithm, we record running means and means of squared parameter values to allow convergence diagnosis and posterior inference while avoiding the costly memory transfer bottleneck. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a model motivated by next generation sequencing data, and we release our implementation in R packages fbseq and fbseqCUDA.},

Recently, Xie, Kou, and Brown proposed a class of estimators for this type of problems and established their asymptotic optimality properties under the assumption of known but unequal variances. In this article, we consider this problem with unequal and unknown variances, which may be more appropriate in real situations. By placing priors for both means and variances, we propose novel SURE-type double shrinkage estimators that shrink both means and variances. Optimal properties for these estimators are derived under certain regularity conditions. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare the newly developed methods with other shrinkage techniques. Finally, the methods are applied to the well-known baseball dataset and a gene expression dataset. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

@article{Schnable2013,
abstract = {Although heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is widely exploited in agriculture, a complete description of its molecular underpinnings has remained elusive despite extensive investigation. It appears that there is not a sin-gle, simple explanation for heterosis. Instead, it is likely that heterosis arises in crosses between genetically distinct individuals as a result of a diversity of mechanisms. Heterosis generally results from the action of multiple loci, and different loci affect heterosis for different traits and in different hybrids. Hence, multigene models are likely to prove most informative for understanding heterosis. Complementation of al-lelic variation, as well as complementation of variation in gene content and gene expression patterns, is likely to be an important contributor to heterosis. Epigenetic variation has the potential to interact in hybrid genotypes via novel mechanisms. Several other intriguing hypotheses are also under investigation. In crops, heterosis must be considered within the context of the genomic impacts of prior selection for agro-nomic traits.},

While this method is based upon the theoretical works of Del Moral et al. (2006), the application to approximate Bayesian computation results in a bias in the approximation to the posterior. An alternative version based on genuine importance sampling arguments bypasses this difficulty, in connection with the population Monte Carlo method of Capp{\'{e}} et al.

abstract = {SUMMARY Combining information across genes in the statistical analysis of microarray data is desirable because of the relatively small number of data points obtained for each individual gene. Here we develop an estimator of the error variance that can borrow information across genes using the James–Stein shrinkage concept. A new test statistic (F S) is constructed using this estimator. The new statistic is compared with other statistics used to test for differential expression: the gene-specific F test (F 1), the pooled-variance F statistic (F 3), a hybrid statistic (F 2) that uses the average of the individual and pooled variances, the regularized t-statistic, the posterior odds statistic B, and the SAM t-test. The F S -test shows best or nearly best power for detecting differentially expressed genes over a wide range of simulated data in which the variance components associated with individual genes are either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Thus F S provides a powerful and robust approach to test differential expression of genes that utilizes information not available in individual gene testing approaches and does not suffer from biases of the pooled variance approach.},

abstract = {Typically, F(1)-hybrids are more vigorous than their homozygous, genetically distinct parents, a phenomenon known as heterosis. In the present study, the transcriptomes of the reciprocal maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids B73×Mo17 and Mo17×B73 and their parental inbred lines B73 and Mo17 were surveyed in primary roots, early in the developmental manifestation of heterotic root traits. The application of statistical methods and a suitable experimental design established that 34,233 (i.e., 86{\%}) of all high-confidence maize genes were expressed in at least one genotype. Nearly 70{\%} of all expressed genes were differentially expressed between the two parents and 42{\%}-55{\%} of expressed genes were differentially expressed between one of the parents and one of the hybrids. In both hybrids, ∼10{\%} of expressed genes exhibited nonadditive gene expression. Consistent with the dominance model (i.e., complementation) for heterosis, 1124 genes that were expressed in the hybrids were expressed in only one of the two parents. For 65 genes, it could be shown that this was a consequence of complementation of genomic presence/absence variation. For dozens of other genes, alleles from the inactive inbred were activated in the hybrid, presumably via interactions with regulatory factors from the active inbred. As a consequence of these types of complementation, both hybrids expressed more genes than did either parental inbred. Finally, in hybrids, ∼14{\%} of expressed genes exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) levels that differed significantly from the parental-inbred expression ratios, providing further evidence for interactions of regulatory factors from one parental genome with target genes from the other parental genome.},

abstract = {Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contribu-tions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January– June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Me-soscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90{\%} BMA prediction intervals were 66{\%} shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7{\%} lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8{\%} lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdis-persed.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

abstract = {Bayes, Jeffreys, Prior Distributions and the Philosophy of Statistics 1 Andrew Gelman I actually own a copy of Harold Jeffreys's Theory of Probability but have only read small bits of it, most recently over a decade ago to confirm that, indeed, Jef-freys was not too proud to use a classical chi-squared p-value when he wanted to check the misfit of a model to data (Gelman, Meng and Stern, 2006). I do, how-ever, feel that it is important to understand where our probability models come from, and I welcome the op-portunity to use the present article by Robert, Chopin and Rousseau as a platform for further discussion of foundational issues. 2 In this brief discussion I will argue the following: (1) in thinking about prior distributions, we should go beyond Jeffreys's principles and move toward weakly informative priors; (2) it is natural for those of us who work in social and computational sciences to favor complex models, contra Jeffreys's preference for sim-plicity; and (3) a key generalization of Jeffreys's ideas is to explicitly include model checking in the process of data analysis.},

The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, includ- ing, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justified theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.},

abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts of wind vectors are becoming critical as interest grows in wind as a clean and re-newable source of energy, in addition to a wide range of other uses, from aviation to recreational boating. Unlike other common forecasting problems, which deal with univariate quantities, statistical approaches to wind vector forecasting must be based on bivariate distributions. The prevailing paradigm in weather fore-casting is to issue deterministic forecasts based on numerical weather prediction models. Uncertainty can then be assessed through ensemble forecasts, where multiple estimates of the current state of the atmosphere are used to generate a collection of deterministic predictions. Ensemble forecasts are often uncalibrated, how-ever, and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a statistical way of postprocessing these forecast ensembles to create calibrated predictive probability density functions (PDFs). It represents the predictive PDF as a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights reflect the forecasts' relative contributions to predictive skill over a training period. In this paper the authors extend the BMA methodology to use bivariate distributions, enabling them to provide probabilistic forecasts of wind vectors. The BMA method is applied to 48-h-ahead forecasts of wind vectors over the North American Pacific Northwest in 2003 using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble and is shown to provide better-calibrated probabilistic forecasts than the raw ensemble, which are also sharper than probabilistic forecasts derived from climatology.},

Its application to the field of wind power forecasting involves a discussion on the choice of the bias term of the quantile models, and the consideration of the operational framework in order to mimic real conditions. Benchmark against linear and splines quantile regression models was performed for a real case study during a 18 months period. Model parameter selection was based on k-fold cross-validation. Results showed a noticeable improvement in terms of calibration, a key criterion for the wind power industry.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have discovered thousands of genetic variants that regulate gene expression, enabling a better understanding of the functional role of non-coding sequences. However, eQTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome-wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele-specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA-seq reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available, it could be inferred from the RNA-seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present QuASAR, quantitative allele-specific analysis of reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls, while including parameters that model base-call errors in sequencing and allelic over-dispersion. We validated our method with experimental data for which high-quality genotypes are available. Results for an additional dataset with multiple replicates at different sequencing depths demonstrate that QuASAR is a powerful tool for ASE analysis when genotypes are not available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: fluca@wayne.edu or rpique@wayne.edu Supplementary information: Supplementary Material is available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq can be used to measure allele-specific expression (ASE) by assigning sequence reads to individual alleles; however, relative ASE is systematically biased when sequence reads are aligned to a single reference genome. Aligning sequence reads to both parental genomes can eliminate this bias, but this approach is not always practical, especially for non-model organisms. To improve accuracy of ASE measured using a single reference genome, we identified properties of differentiating sites responsible for biased measures of relative ASE.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that clusters of differentiating sites prevented sequence reads from an alternate allele from aligning to the reference genome, causing a bias in relative ASE favoring the reference allele. This bias increased with greater sequence divergence between alleles. Increasing the number of mismatches allowed when aligning sequence reads to the reference genome and restricting analysis to genomic regions with fewer differentiating sites than the number of mismatches allowed almost completely eliminated this systematic bias. Accuracy of allelic abundance was increased further by excluding differentiating sites within sequence reads that could not be aligned uniquely within the genome (imperfect mappability) and reads that overlapped one or more insertions or deletions (indels) between alleles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: After aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome, excluding differentiating sites with at least as many neighboring differentiating sites as the number of mismatches allowed, imperfect mappability, and/or an indel(s) nearby resulted in measures of allelic abundance comparable to those derived from aligning sequence reads to both parental genomes.},

abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper, we consider the one-way random effects model as a Bayesian hierarchical structure, assuming normality for the first stage. We take scale mixtures of normal (SMN) distributions for the random effects in order to study the influential effects of aberrant random effects. For the sake of simplicity, coNugate priors are assigned to the hyperparameters. We show that the Gibbs sampler deals with this extension without any difficulties. The required random variate generation from the full conditionals of the mixing parameters of the SMN distributions is discussed at length. Potential outliers can be identified using these mixing parameters. More importantly, we show that the SMN distributions can protect inference from outliers and robustified analyses are therefore provided. Finally, we study the sensitivity of Bayes estimates of the population parameters to the choice of the second stage prior for the random effects.},

In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al., 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by pre-existing methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies. We also provide a sample analysis of a colon cancer trial comparing time-to-disease progression using a Weibull regression model.},

Further- more, for such a choice of bandwidth we can implement an importance sampling algorithm to sample from the ABC posterior whose acceptance probability tends to 1 as we increase the data sample size. This compares favorably to results for standard ABC, where the only way to obtain an ABC posterior that correctly quantifies uncertainty is to choose a much smaller bandwidth, for which the acceptance probability tends to 0 and hence for which Monte Carlo error will dominate.},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) is collecting RNA-seq data on multiple tissues of a same set of individuals and novel methods are required for the analysis of these data. Results: We present a statistical method to compare different patterns of ASE across tissues and to classify genetic variants according to their impact on the tissue-wide expression profile. We focus on strong ASE effects that we are expecting to see for protein-truncating variants, but our method can also be adjusted for other types of ASE effects. We illustrate the method with a real data example on a tissue-wide expression profile of a variant causal for lipoid proteinosis, and with a simulation study to assess our method more generally.

abstract = {Allele-specific expression refers to the preferential expression of one of the two alleles in a diploid genome, which has been thought largely attributable to the associated cis-element variation and allele-specific epigenetic modification patterns. Allele-specific expression may contribute to the heterosis (or hybrid vigor) effect in hybrid plants that are produced from crosses of closely-related species, subspecies and/or inbred lines. In this study, using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of maize transcriptomics, chromatic H3K27me3 histone modification and DNA methylation data, we developed a new computational framework to identify allele-specifically expressed genes by simultaneously tracking allele-specific gene expression patterns and the epigenetic modification landscape in the seedling tissues of hybrid maize. This approach relies on detecting nucleotide polymorphisms and any genomic structural variation between two parental genomes in order to distinguish paternally or maternally derived sequencing reads. This computational pipeline also incorporates a modified Chi-square test to statistically identify allele-specific gene expression and epigenetic modification based on the Poisson distribution.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing is quickly replacing microarrays as a technique to probe different molecular levels of the cell, such as DNA or RNA. The technology provides higher resolution, while reducing bias. RNA sequencing results in counts of RNA strands. This type of data imposes new statistical challenges. We present a novel, generic approach to model and analyze such data. Our approach aims at large flexibility of the likelihood (count) model and the regression model alike. Hence, a variety of count models is supported, such as the popular NB model, which accounts for overdispersion. In addition, complex, non-balanced designs and random effects are accommodated. Like some other methods, our method provides shrinkage of dispersion-related parameters. However, we extend it by enabling joint shrinkage of parameters, including those for which inference is desired. We argue that this is essential for Bayesian multiplicity correction. Shrinkage is effectuated by empirically estimating priors. We discuss several parametric (mixture) and non-parametric priors and develop procedures to estimate (parameters of) those. Inference is provided by means of local and Bayesian false discovery rates. We illustrate our method on several simulations and two data sets, also to compare it with other methods. Model- and data-based simulations show substantial improvements in the sensitivity at the given specificity. The data motivate the use of the ZI-NB as a powerful alternative to the NB, which results in higher detection rates for low-count data. Finally, compared with other methods, the results on small sample subsets are more reproducible when validated on their large sample complements, illustrating the importance of the type of shrinkage.},

In these settings, population-level surveillance of drug resistance is needed to characterize the prevalence of resistance mutations and to enable antiretroviral therapy programs to select the optimal regimen for their local population. The surveillance strategy currently recommended by the World Health Organization is prohibitively expensive in some settings and may not provide a sufficiently precise rendering of the emergence of drug resistance. By using a novel assay on pooled sera samples, we decrease surveillance costs while simultaneously increasing the accuracy of drug resistance prevalence estimates for an important mutation that impacts first-line antiretroviral therapy. We present a Bayesian model for pooled-testing data that garners more information from each resistance assay conducted, compared with individual testing. We expand on previous pooling methods to account for uncertainty about the population distribution of within-subject resistance levels. In addition, our model accounts for measurement error of the resistance assay, and this added uncertainty naturally propagates through the Bayesian model to our inference on the prevalence parameter. We conduct a simulation study that informs our pool size recommendations and that shows that this model renders the prevalence parameter identifiable in instances when an existing non-model-based estimator fails.},

This is already the case today for a number of European countries, closely followed by the US and high growth countries, for example, Brazil, India and China. There exist a number of techno-logical, environmental and political challenges linked to supplement-ing existing electricity generation capacities with wind energy. Here, mathematicians and statisticians could make a substantial contribu-tion at the interface of meteorology and decision-making, in connec-tion with the generation of forecasts tailored to the various operational decision problems involved. Indeed, while wind energy may be seen as an environmentally friendly source of energy, full benefits from its us-age can only be obtained if one is able to accommodate its variability and limited predictability. Based on a short presentation of its phys-ical basics, the importance of considering wind power generation as a stochastic process is motivated. After describing representative op-erational decision-making problems for both market participants and system operators, it is underlined that forecasts should be issued in a probabilistic framework. Even though, eventually, the forecaster may only communicate single-valued predictions. The existing approaches to wind power forecasting are subsequently described, with focus on single-valued predictions, predictive marginal densities and space–time trajectories. Upcoming challenges related to generating improved and new types of forecasts, as well as their verification and value to forecast users, are finally discussed.},

@article{Berry1999,
abstract = {We discuss Bayesian attitudes towards adjusting inferences for multiplicities. In the simplest Bayesian view, there is no need for adjustments and the Bayesian perspective is similar to that of the frequentist who makes inferences on a per-comparison basis. However, as we explain, Bayesian thinking can lead to making adjustments that are in the same spirit as those made by frequentists who subscribe to preserving the familywise error rate. We describe the differences between assuming independent prior distributions and hierarchical prior distributions. As an example of the latter, we illustrate the use of a Dirichlet process prior distribution in the context of multiplicities. We also discuss some quasi-Bayesian procedures which combine Bayesian and frequentist ideas. This shows the potential of Bayesian methodology to yield procedures that can be evaluated using “objective” criteria. Finally, we comment on the role of subjectivity in Bayesian approaches to the complex realm of multiple comparisons problems, and on robust vs. informative priors.},

abstract = {One method of identifying cis regulatory differences is to analyze allele-specific expression (ASE) and identify cases of allelic imbalance (AI). RNA-seq is the most common way to measure ASE and a binomial test is often applied to determine statistical significance of AI. This implicitly assumes that there is no bias in estimation of AI. However, bias has been found to result from multiple factors including: genome ambiguity, reference quality, the mapping algorithm, and biases in the sequencing process. Two alternative approaches have been developed to handle bias: adjusting for bias using a statistical model and filtering regions of the genome suspected of harboring bias. Existing statistical models which account for bias rely on information from DNA controls, which can be cost prohibitive for large intraspecific studies. In contrast, data filtering is inexpensive and straightforward, but necessarily involves sacrificing a portion of the data. Here we propose a flexible Bayesian model for analysis of AI, which accounts for bias and can be implemented without DNA controls. In lieu of DNA controls, this Poisson-Gamma (PG) model uses an estimate of bias from simulations. The proposed model always has a lower type I error rate compared to the binomial test. Consistent with prior studies, bias dramatically affects the type I error rate. All of the tested models are sensitive to misspecification of bias. The closer the estimate of bias is to the true underlying bias, the lower the type I error rate. Correct estimates of bias result in a level alpha test. To improve the assessment of AI, some forms of systematic error (e.g., map bias) can be identified using simulation. The resulting estimates of bias can be used to correct for bias in the PG model, without data filtering. Other sources of bias (e.g., unidentified variant calls) can be easily captured by DNA controls, but are missed by common filtering approaches. Consequently, as variant identification improves, the need for DNA controls will be reduced. Filtering does not significantly improve performance and is not recommended, as information is sacrificed without a measurable gain. The PG model developed here performs well when bias is known, or slightly misspecified. The model is flexible and can accommodate differences in experimental design and bias estimation.},

Motivated by the growth in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches to this question make intensive use of simulation methods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

abstract = {Heterosis is the phenomenon whereby the progeny of particular inbred lines have enhanced agronomic performance relative to both parents. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this fundamental biological phenomenon, the responsible molecular mechanisms have not been determined. The maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 produce a heterotic F1 hybrid. Global patterns of gene expression were compared in seedlings of these three genotypes by using a microarray that contains 13,999 cDNAs. Using an estimated 15{\%} false discovery rate as a cutoff, 1,367 ESTs (9.8{\%}) were identified as being significantly differentially expressed among genotypes. All possible modes of gene action were observed, including additivity, high- and low-parent dominance, underdominance, and overdominance. The largest proportion of the ESTs (78{\%}; 1,062 of 1,367) exhibited expression patterns that are not statistically distinguishable from additivity. Even so, 22{\%} of the differentially regulated ESTs exhibited nonadditive modes of gene expression. Classified on the basis of significant pairwise comparisons of genotype means, 181 of these 305 nonadditive ESTs exhibited high-parent dominance and 23 exhibited low-parent dominance. In addition, 44 ESTs exhibited underdominance or overdominance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple molecular mechanisms, including overdominance, contribute to heterosis.},
